                                        <p></p><p>Long before the American West was settled, it had been crisscrossed by lone scouts and hunters and trappers searching for new untouched &nbsp;trapping grounds. At the center of this fur trading enterprise stood the Hudson’s Bay Company and its main post, Fort Vancouver. As the vagaries of fashion carried the beaver hat to the height of popularity, the demand for that animal’s fur increased enormously. From Fort Vancouver the Hudson’s Bay Company sent out brigades of trappers that included from 50 to 200 men, women, and children. Trapping was hard and often dangerous work, particularly because most of it was done in the winter, when the pelts are the thickest.</p><br><p>The earliest trappers had adopted the Indians’ method of breaking into a beaver lodge and taking the animals, but soon the steel trap came into use.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

                                        <p></p><p>Fort Vancouver was headquarters for the Hudson’s Bay Company’s Columbia Department, embracing present-day British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. The trading post also represented Britain’s business and governmental interests in competition with the United States.</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">The fort’s warehouses stocked supplies for the fur brigades, the Indian and settler trade, and for the 20 to 30 other Company posts in the Department. Most Indians were shrewd traders, so trade goods were carefully chosen. Almost all trade items were imported from or through Britain, so there was a two-year lapse between ordering and receiving.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">The fort’s shops bustled with activity, manufacturing as many items as possible. The fort echoed to the sounds of carpenters hammering and sawing, of blacksmiths making new tools and repairing old ones, and of coopers making barrels. Carts rumbled to and fro piled high with supplies and with firewood for the bakehouse’s large brick ovens. Indians arrived to trade, passing by farmers and herders tending crops and livestock.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Company clerks bent over account books figuring out how much who owed whom. Frequent visitors were welcomed and eagerly quizzed for news and gossip of the outside. The arrival of a supply ship or a Royal Navy vessel was cause for celebration.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Although everyone worked hard and long hours—Sunday was the only day of rest in the early years—free time was enjoyed to the fullest. Hunting, riding, picnicking, footracing, and other competitive feats of strength were favored pastimes. Once a group of naval officers produced a play, the first known theatrical performance in the Pacific Northwest.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Clerks and officers, who came from the British Isles and Canada, formed &nbsp;what was known as the “gentlemen” class. The working lower class, or engagés, made up most of the employees. Gentlemen and their families &nbsp;lived a comfortable life within the fort’s palisade, while laborers lived in crude dwellings in the village.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">The workers at the fort represented many nationalities. George Simpson wrote a description of a trip down the Columbia River that indicated the diversity of Fort Vancouver. “Our crew of ten men contained Iroquois who spoke their own tongue; a Cree halfbreed of French origin, who appeared to have borrowed his dialect from both his parents; a North Briton who understood only the Gaellic of his native hills; Canadians who, of course, knew French, and Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islanders, who jabbered a medley of chinook and their own vernacular jargon. Add to all this that the passengers were natives of England, Scotland, Russia, Canada, and the Hudson Bay Territories.”</span></p><p></p>
