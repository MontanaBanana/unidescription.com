This artifact &nbsp;is an unfinished piece of gray stone, about 18 inches long, 5 inches wide and four deep, etched with a cross, a stick figure of a man and the letters &quot;JR.&quot; &nbsp;It may be that this stone once marked the grave of one Rodriguez club Rio, but we may never know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo caption:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COURTESY LOWIE MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY, U.

Exactly what happened is a mystery. One account says that &lt;strong&gt;Cabreeyo&lt;/strong&gt;, while rushing to aid his men during a fight with Chumash Indians, jumped from a boat and broke his leg. Another version notes that he had broken his arm near the shoulder on an earlier visit to &lt;strong&gt;La Po ses see own&lt;/strong&gt;. Whatever happened, complications ensued&mdash;with fatal results. On January 3, 1543, his goals of&nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.4285;&quot;&gt;exploration unfulfilled, &lt;strong&gt;Cabreeyo&lt;/strong&gt; died.

How far they got is unclear, but they may have reached the Rogue River area in Oregon. In March La Victoria disappeared in a storm. Reunited after three weeks, Ferrer and the crew abandoned the expedition, returning to Navidad on April 14, 1543.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition claimed over 800 miles of coastline for Spain. It did not find a route to Asia or the Spice Islands, the mythical Strait of Ani&aacute;n, or gold. What Cabrillo did accomplish was of lasting importance. His voyage added knowledge of landmarks, winds, and currents, making later exploration safer. Based in part on his voyage, a west-to-east Pacific crossing 22 years later set up trade routes between New Spain and the Philippines, paving the way for the Manila galleons and helping link the world&rsquo;s continents.

OF CALIF., BERKELEY;<br></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Text:</strong></p><p>In November the expedition stopped for water on one of the Channel Islands. Exactly what happened is a mystery. One account says that <strong>Cabreeyo</strong>, while rushing to aid his men during a fight with Chumash Indians, jumped from a boat and broke his leg. Another version notes that he had broken his arm near the shoulder on an earlier visit to <strong>La Po ses see own</strong>. Whatever happened, complications ensued—with fatal results. On January 3, 1543, his goals of&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.4285;">exploration unfulfilled, <strong>Cabreeyo</strong> died. The cause of death was probably infection.</span></p><span style="line-height: 1.4285;"></span><span style="line-height: 1.4285;">
</span><p>Chief pilot Bartolo<strong>may</strong> de Ferrer (Ferrelo) took command and, heeding Cabrillo’s wishes to discover more coastland, headed north. How far they got is unclear, but they may have reached the Rogue River area in Oregon. In March La Victoria disappeared in a storm. Reunited after three weeks, Ferrer and the crew abandoned the expedition, returning to Navidad on April 14, 1543.</p><p>The expedition claimed over 800 miles of coastline for Spain. It did not find a route to Asia or the Spice Islands, the mythical Strait of Anián, or gold. What Cabrillo did accomplish was of lasting importance. His voyage added knowledge of landmarks, winds, and currents, making later exploration safer. Based in part on his voyage, a west-to-east Pacific crossing 22 years later set up trade routes between New Spain and the Philippines, paving the way for the Manila galleons and helping link the world’s continents. The Spanish age of exploration gave way to the Colonial era.</p>													</div>

Reunited after three weeks, Ferrer and the crew abandoned the expedition, returning to Navidad on April 14, 1543.

The expedition claimed over 800 miles of coastline for Spain. It did not find a route to Asia or the Spice Islands, the mythical Strait of Anián, or gold. What <strong>Cabreeyo </strong>did accomplish was of lasting importance. His voyage added knowledge of landmarks, winds, and currents, making later exploration safer. Based in part on his voyage, a west-to-east Pacific crossing 22 years later set up trade routes between New Spain and the Philippines, paving the way for the Manila galleons and helping link the world’s continents. The Spanish age of exploration gave way to the Colonial era.

														<p>In November the expedition stopped for water on one of the Channel Islands. Exactly what happened is a mystery. One account says that <strong>Cabreeyo</strong>, while rushing to aid his men during a fight with Chumash Indians, jumped from a boat and broke his leg. Another version notes that he had broken his arm near the shoulder on an earlier visit to <strong>La Po ses see own</strong>. Whatever happened, complications ensued—with fatal results. On January 3, 1543, his goals of exploration unfulfilled,<strong> Cabreeyo</strong> died. The cause of death was probably infection.
 
Chief pilot Bartolomay de Ferrer (Ferrelo) took command and, heeding Cabrillo’s wishes to discover more coastland, headed north. How far they got is unclear, but they may have reached the Rogue River area in Oregon. In March La Victoria disappeared in a storm. Reunited after three weeks, Ferrer and the crew abandoned the expedition, returning to Navidad on April 14, 1543.

The expedition claimed over 800 miles of coastline for Spain. It did not find a route to Asia or the Spice Islands, the mythical Strait of Anián, or gold. What <strong>Cabreeyo </strong>did accomplish was of lasting importance. His voyage added knowledge of landmarks, winds, and currents, making later exploration safer. Based in part on his voyage, a west-to-east Pacific crossing 22 years later set up trade routes between New Spain and the Philippines, paving the way for the Manila galleons and helping link the world’s continents. The Spanish age of exploration gave way to the Colonial era.

														<p>In November the expedition stopped for water<strong> on one&nbsp;of the</strong> Channel Islands. Exactly what happened is a mystery. One account says that Cabrillo, while rushing to aid his men during a fight with Chumash Indians, jumped from a boat and broke his leg. Another version notes that he had broken his arm near the shoulder on an earlier visit to La Posesión. Whatever happened, complications ensued—with fatal results. On January 3, 1543, his goals of exploration unfulfilled, Cabrillo died. The cause of death was probably infection.
</p>
<p>There is almost no physical evidence of the passage of Cabrillo and his crew with the exception of a single piece of stone found on Santa Rosa Island in 1901. This artifact  is an unfinished piece of gray stone, about 18 inches long, 5 inches wide and four deep, etched with a cross, a stick figure of a man and the letters "JR."

<p>The expedition claimed over 800 miles of coastline for Spain. It did not find a route to Asia or the Spice Islands, the mythical Strait of Anián, or gold. What Cabrillo did accomplish was of lasting importance. His voyage added knowledge of landmarks, winds, and currents, making later exploration safer. Based in part on his voyage, a west-to-east Pacific crossing 22 years later set up trade routes between New Spain and the Philippines, paving the way for the Manila galleons and helping link the world’s continents. The Spanish age of exploration gave way to the Colonial era.</p>													</div>

Reunited after three weeks, Ferrer and the crew abandoned the expedition, returning to Navidad on April 14, 1543.

The expedition claimed over 800 miles of coastline for Spain. It did not find a route to Asia or the Spice Islands, the mythical Strait of Anián, or gold. What Cabrillo did accomplish was of lasting importance. His voyage added knowledge of landmarks, winds, and currents, making later exploration safer. Based in part on his voyage, a west-to-east Pacific crossing 22 years later set up trade routes between New Spain and the Philippines, paving the way for the Manila galleons and helping link the world’s continents. The Spanish age of exploration gave way to the Colonial era.
