A series of rectangular, oval, and cut-out black-and-white photos of Truman chronologically throughout his life are shown along the top of the brochure.
</p>
The text reads:&nbsp;<p>As a child he dreamed of being a concert pianist and of going to college. Instead, at 17 he had to start working full time. At 33 he deemed himself a failure. By 38 his clothing business was bankrupt. Determined to succeed at something he entered politics, eventually becoming a US senator. At 60 he was suddenly President of the United States, facing decisions that held worldwide consequences. Who was this common man abruptly thrust into this uncommon role?

</p><p>Harry S Truman was born in rural Missouri but claimed Independence as his hometown.
</p><p>
A rectangular, black-and-white photo above shows Independence Square in the early nineteen hundreds. At an intersection with a few trees on a hill and western storefronts along the other side of the street, a man stands next to his horse-drawn wagon. A dog and another wagon approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The text continues.
</p><p>The family moved there when he was six. That year Harry met five-year-old Bess Wallace, daughter of a prominent family. All his school years Harry adored Bess, the “beautiful young lady with the blue eyes and golden hair,” a popular girl and an accomplished athlete. But the frail-looking boy with thick glasses did not appeal to Bess. It took years for Harry to overcome his shyness and strike up a true friendship. 
</p><p>
Truman’s mother, Martha, instilled in Harry a love of music and books. He practiced the piano before school and by 14 had “read all the books in the Independence Public Library.” Truman’s father, John, taught him the worth of hard work and of Midwestern values—honesty, courage, and perseverance.&nbsp;</p><p>
An oval photo shows Harry Truman age 19, 1903. He has a round face, and wears glasses and a dark jacket and tie over a white shirt. His dark hair is parted slightly left of center. &nbsp;<br>
</p><p>Text:
</p><p>In 1900 Truman got his first taste of politics when his father took him to the Democratic National Convention in Kansas City. Truman loved the excitement of the nominations and the promises of better times in the new century. But better times did not include young Truman. In 1901 his father dashed his dreams of college by losing the family savings in risky investments. Truman eventually found a good job as a bank clerk in Kansas City. He went to concerts and joined the National Guard. 
</p>

</p>
<p>At age 22 his life changed again when Truman’s father summoned him to help on the farm in Grandview. Truman heeded the call. He had never farmed before, and it was arduous work for someone used to city life.
</p>
<p>A rectangular photo shows Truman riding a cultivator on the Grandview farm, 1910. Two harnessed horses pull a plow with a large wheel on each side, while he rides in long sleeves, trousers, and a hat.

</p><p>In 1910 Harry and Bess crossed paths again. While visiting his aunt and uncle, the Nolands in Independence, Truman volunteered to return a cake plate to a neighbor, Mrs. Madge Wallace. Bess greeted him at the door, and their courtship began. He wrote Bess letters from Grandview and, in 1911, proposed marriage. She turned him down. 
</p>
<p>By 1917, 33-year-old Truman was in the midst of World War I as an officer in the US Army. Captain Harry inspired his troops in France with his courage and determination. He brooked no insubordination, and he lost no man in battle. Finally Truman felt successful. His persistence paid off too when Bess Wallace agreed to marry him on June 28, 1919. Truman opened a clothing store in Kansas City, and business thrived until a depression closed the shop. By 1922 Truman was looking for work. 
</p>
<p>Truman’s next job, politics, turned into a lifelong career. “Boss” Tom Pendergast, whose nephew knew Harry from Army days, backed Truman’s run for eastern district judge (an administrative position) of Jackson County. Truman campaigned hard, won, and loved the job.

</p><p>Just below it, is a cut-out color photo of a gold badge with the caption: Truman’s official badge as presiding judge. An adjacent color photo is of his Missouri Democratic Convention pin from April 15, 1940
.</p>
<p>Text continues: His reputation for integrity and hard work impressed voters enough to win him a US Senate seat. The Truman family moved to Washington, DC, in 1935 but 
all remained Missourians at heart. In January 1945 Truman became Franklin D. Roosevelt’s vice president. Roosevelt died on April 12 and at 7:09 pm, Harry S Truman became the 33rd US president.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>

First he carried on the drive to end World War II. He then turned to rebuilding war-torn Europe and halting Communist expansion. A series of crises, the Korean War in particular, kept Truman away from Independence even more than during his senate years. Truman did not seek a third term. “I have had all of Washington I want,” he wrote. “I prefer my life in Missouri.” Back home Truman enjoyed his walks and being with his family and friends once more.

</p><p>Would you wear a solitaire on your left hand should I get it?... You know, were I an Italian or a poet I would commence and use all the luscious language of two continents. I am not either but only … [an] American farmer …. I’ve been crazy about you ever since we went to Sunday school together. But I never had the nerve to think you’d even look at me.
</p><p>More than sincerely, 
</p><p>Harry

 &nbsp;The Truman Farm—Then and Now</p><p>
Truman returned to Grandview in 1906 to help on the 600-acre family farm. The house had no electricity or indoor plumbing. Backbreaking labor began at 5 am and lasted 12 to 14 hours. “There is always something the matter with a crop,” he wrote to Bess in 1913. “It’s either too dry or too wet or too short or too long or too much or not enough. If is the largest word in a farmer’s language.” Truman’s father died in 1914, and the full responsibility for running the farm fell upon 30-year-old Harry. Truman accepted the challenge, and it taught him what became his best-known quality—common sense. “It was on the farm that Harry got his common sense,” his mother Martha once said. “He didn’t get it in town.” &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Harry S Truman National Historic Site includes the old Grandview farm house and 11 acres of the original 600-acre farm where Harry Truman lives from age 22–33 (1906–1917). These years represent a lesser-known period of Truman's life. Here he grew from a young man of modest ambitions into the person that would become the President of the US. A visit here can provide a more complete picture of this man who held the nation’s highest office.
</p><p><br></p><p>A large color photo shows a two-story white farm house with a gabled roof sitting on a large green lawn with a line of autumn’s trees on each side of the house. The caption reads: Today the Truman Farm Home and 11 acres are all that remain of the family farm. Harry wrote letters to Bess on a desk like this one in the farm’s dining room.

</p>
Harry had help in winning Bess’ heart. By coincidence his relatives, the Nolands, lived across the street from the Wallaces. During a visit in 1910, Harry happily volunteered to return a cake plate to 219 N. Delaware, where Bess had lived since 1904. This encounter changed their lives forever. &nbsp;<br>
Harry began regular visits from Grandview, and to save a round-trip, he often slept in the Noland parlor. In 1919 Truman married Bess and moved into the Wallace home. Bess’ mother Madge lived in the home, and her brothers Frank and George had cottages behind the main house. The families enjoyed being together. The Trumans never allowed fame to come between them and their dearest friends—their family.&nbsp;<br>

<p>A map shows places related to Harry S Truman National Historic Site and Harry and Bess’ lives. In Independence, Truman Road runs East/West and most of the park sites a located along or near Truman Road. US Highway 24, also named Independence Avenue, is about 5 blocks north of Truman Road. Some of the north/south roads that connect Truman and Independence Roads in a typical street grid, listed from west to east, are River Road, Delaware Avenue, and Noland Road. All map sites are between River and Noland Road within about one square mile. From West to East, the following park sites are located on the south side of Truman Road: the Noland Home, the Truman Home, both Wallace Homes, and several blocks east is the Visitor Center. All are located within the Harry S Truman National Historic Landmark District along with other relevant sites, like Independence High School, the First Presbyterian Church, Clinton’s Drugstore, and the Jackson County courthouse. Also within the historic district but north of Truman Road are the Truman Boyhood Home, the Site of the Bess Wallace Home, and the Truman Presidential Museum and Library which is also north of Independence Avenue.

</p><p>Strolling around Independence is like stepping back in time. Its small downtown area and historic neighborhood are largely unchanged from the time when Truman walked these streets over 40 years ago. Be sure to see Independence Square, Jackson County Courthouse, the Truman statue, and Clinton’s Drugstore. Neighborhood highlights include the Noland, Truman, and Wallace homes on Delaware Ave. and Truman Rd. At the park visitor center get the free, self-guiding Harry S Truman Walking Trail brochure that tells you about over 40 sites in the historic district.
</p>
<p>It is a short drive to the Truman Presidential Museum and Library, where Harry and Bess Truman are buried.

</p><p>The first shows the farm house slightly overgrown with several large trees in the foreground. The caption reads:
</p>
<p>In 1940 creditors forced the sale of the farm. A sheriff ordered Truman’s mother and sister to leave. Truman lamented to Bess that his mother “has been calling that farm home since 1868. She helped her father set out those maple trees in the fall of that year. . . .”
